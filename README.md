Files include: scwdbms (sample data for the database system), the application (WasteCollectionDBMS.jar file), and the source codes.

Note: In order for the WasteCollectionDBMS.jar file to work, the whole "Application" folder and its contents should be downloaded. alternatively, the zip file can be downloaded.
The swcdbms.sql file contains images, contained in blob/byte, which explains the random numbers/characters.
